It
Started
Curved
The
apostrophe
first
appeared
in
the
printed
universe
in
Italy
th
century
as
a
curved
shape
to
signify
elision
copied
from
handwritten
classical
Italian
poetry
The
apostrophe
was
equivalent
to
our
Gotchas
or
Wannas
in
the
sense
that
it
was
a
way
to
take
the
stiffness
of
the
text
away
by
making
it
sound
more
human-like
Here
is
an
example
of
one
of
the
first
times
the
apostrophe
was
printed
It
is
from
Le
cose
volgari
di
messer
Francesco
an
Italian
classic
written
by
Petrarch
published
by
Aldus
Manutius

He
had
to
introduce
the

glyph
in

to
be

to
copy
the
text
exactly
the
way

had

innovative
Italic
type
and
the

as
a

small
mark
gained
immediate
fame
Even
when
the
typeface
was
protected
by
the
Pope
himself
it
started
being

copied
by

artists

With
the
invention
of
the
typewriters
and
keyboards
s
the
engineers
were
faced
with
the
problem
of
fitting
many
characters
keys
in
a
small
space
They
came
up
with
the
idea
of
unifying
similar
looking
characters
in
order
to
save
space
Instead
of
having
the
left
right
and
straight
apostrophes
they
decided
to
include
only
the
straight
one
Similar
decisions
were
made
about

then

It

only
with
the
popularization
of

that
the
curly
apostrophes
were
reintroduced
into
the
digital
world
Systems
like
Word
offered
the
feature
to
automatically
substitute
the
straight
apostrophe
with
curly
quotation
marks
based

It
was

To
add
to
the
confusion
the
standard
keyboards
did
not
include
the
curly
quotation

it
was
very
hard
for
the
regular
user
to
type
them
intentionally
When
Unicode
was
created
one
of
the
design
principles
was
to
unify
characters
Characters
from
different
scripts
or
languages
that
looked
similar
were
to
be
unified
and
simplified

You
would
think
they
would

by
this
point
the
confusion

The
Apostrophe
Today
So
as
it
is
today
both
the
curly
and
the
straight
apostrophe
are
accepted
as
an
apostrophe
and
quotation
mark
but
there
are
some
considerations
If
the
intention
of
the
text
is
to
make
it
look
as
if
it
was
traditionally
typeset
then
always
use
curly
ones
as
it
was
originally
Keep
the
straight
one
to
denote
prime
Using
the
straight
apostrophe
and
quotation
can
be
a
way
of
implying
a
digital
mood
to
your
document
the
same
way
characters
of
the
same
width
imply
that
the
text
was
typed
in
a
typewriter
or
console
If
the
text
is
digital
and
to
be
consumed
by
human
eyes
both
the
curly
and
the
straight
apostrophe
are
accepted
as
an
apostrophe
and
quotation
mark
Here

differ
and
schism
rules
We
keep
on
with
the

mess
Just
be
consistent
within

If
the
intention
of
the
text
is
to
be
semantically
correct
as
if
you
want
a
computer
to
be
able
to
parse
the
semantics
of
the
text
then
you
should
pay
close
attention
to
Unicode
s
definition
of
the
characters
U
the
one
that
can
be
typed
with
the
keyboard
is
named
APOSTROPHE
Although
that
hints
that
it
could
be
a
good
candidate
to
represent
apostrophes
notice
that
Unicode
is
kind
of
ambiguos
about
this
character
indicating
that
at
least
in
English
language
U
is
the
preferred
one
for
apostrophes
I
personally
think
this
goes
against
their
principle
of
unification
You
would
expect
that
the
apostrophe
would
be
the
same
independently
of
the
language
in
which
it
is
used
Add
to
that
the
fact
that
they
classify
the
apostrophe
as
punctuation
which
in
French
could
be
awkwardly
accepted
but
in
English
makes
no
sense
whatsoever
You
are
left
then
with
the
quandary
of
either
using
different
apostrophes
for
different
languages
or
using
the
controversial
one
for
the
English
language
Discussions
about
which
one
is
the
correct
one
can
get
very
passionate
On
the
other
hand
it
seems
quite
clear
that
U
and
never
the
straight
one
should
be
used
as
a
right
quotation
mark
By
the
same
token
U
should
be
used
to
denote
prime
and
U
BC
should
be
used
to
denote
a
modifier
letter
apostrophe
such
as
in
the
glottal
stop
of
the
Cockney
pronunciation
of
bu
er
or
the
transcription
of
uh
oh
Please
notice
that
even
if
you
select
or
type
the
correct
character
the
font
you
use
might
render
it
in

The
Unicode
Standard
comments
on
U
this
is
the
preferred
character
to
use
for
apostrophe
As
far
as
what
is
right
encoding-wise
I
cannot
think
of
a
higher
authority
Also
the
typographical
conventions
of
most
languages
do
not
use
U
for
other
purposes
or
only
as
secondary
quotation
marks
In
fact
British
English
is
the
only
major
language
using
this
character
as
a
primary
quotation
mark
Thus
there
is
no
big
need
to
use
U
or
any
other
character
for
the
sake
of
distinction
here
Typographically
there
are
three
approaches
to
determining
what
is
right
What
people
are
used
to
While
in
classical
and
professional
typesetting
people
are
primarily
exposed
to
the
curly
apostrophe
the
typewriter
apostrophe
dominates
digital
texts
There
is
no
good
answer
here
What
fits
the
general
character
of
the
typeface
without
significantly
impeding
readability
This
somewhat
depends
on
the
typeface
look
at
some
examples
enter
image
description
here
In
all
examples
the
apostrophe
in
is
U
and
the
apostrophe
in
is
U
First
note
how
both
characters
differ
over
the
typefaces
The
first
example
is
a
light
sans-serif
font
It
is
far
from
ornamental
and
a
curly
apostrophe
would
be
out
of
place
Consequently
U
is
only
slightly
tilted
The
straight
U
fits
the
simple
character
also
quite
well
Round
forms
obviously
are
a
major
paradigm
of
the
typeface
in
the
second
example
Consequently
U
is
curly
U
is
designed
to
avoid
any
sense
of
direction
presumably
to
be
also
usable
as
an
opening
quotation
mark
and
hence
curves
Also
it
is
rather
small
presumably
a
trade-off
between
avoiding
to
disturb
the
character
of
the
typeface
with
a
big
character
and
impeding
readability
with
a
tiny
character
If
you
ask
me
the
trade-off
is
too
tiny
but
only
the
symptom
the
actual
problem
is
the
trade-off
which
can
be
avoided
by
using
a
curly
apostrophe
which
fits
the
typeface
much
better
In
classical
serif
typefaces
as
in
the
third
example
the
width
of
a
stroke
mainly
depends
on
the
angle
which
has
its
origins
in
calligraphy
Straight
vertical
lines
are
usually
ended
with
serifs
This
is
not
an
option
for
the
apostrophe
and
hence
U
uses
a
droplet-like
shape
and
thus
breaks
the
character
in
my
opinion
Admittedly
the
same
applies
to
the
exclamation
mark
but
at
least
that
character
shall
disturb
anyway
The
curly
U
fits
the
character
of
the
typeface
much
better
in
my
opinion
The
last
typeface
is
even
more
calligraphic
but
its
character
offers
another
way
of
designing
purely
vertical
elements
Thus
U
is
not
as
disturbing
and
differs
not
as
much
from
U
To
summarise
this
point
It
depends
on
the
font
but
a
properly
designed
U
should
never
be
worse
than
U
even
if
the
latter
is
well
designed
This
is
little
surprising
because
the
type
designer
is
more
flexible
to
shape
U
to
match
the
rest
of
the
typeface
as
there
is
no
symmetry
required
What
is
best
for
readability
on
the
long
run
Using
the
same
character
for
many
purposes
is
arguably
not
good
for
readability
Thus
if
we
assume
British
typesetting
conventions
unchanged
otherwise
a
straight
apostrophe
has
the
advantage
of
being
distinguishable
from
the
curly
closing
quotation
mark
However
this
convention
use
U
for
the
apostrophe
and
U
for
the
single
closing
quotation
mark
is
even
more
difficult
to
establish
than
establishing
the
use
of
curly
quotation
marks
and
apostrophes
in
the
digital
world
In
many
other
languages
this
would
make
little
sense
as
U
is
not
used
as
a
quotation
mark
anyway
In
languages
like
German
which
use
the
turned
U
the
English
single
opening
quotation
mark
as
a
quotation
mark
having
two
opposite
curls
or
inclinations
depending
on
the
typeface
often
makes
for
a
better
distinction
at
least
in
my
opinion

First
some
history
Curly
quotes
and
apostrophes
were
the
original
style
They
are
also
called
Printer
s
quotes
and
apostrophes
Straight
quotes
and
apostrophes
came
along
with
the
typewriter
The
typewriter
being
a
mechanical
device
with
limitations
decided
that
it
made
more
sense
to
use
one
set
of
straight
marks
instead
of
two
separate
sets
of
curly
marks
for
open
and
close
single
and
double
quotes
To
add
further
to
the
confusion
Primes
are
also
a
character
that
looks
like
an
angled
straight
apostrophe
Primes
are
used
for
minute
second
markings
as
well
as
other
scientific
mathematical
and
music
notation
Again
the
typewriter
s
straight
apostrophes
were
also
able
to
be
used
for
these
All
that
said
some
typefaces
are
only
designed
with
straight
apostrophes
and
quotes
for
stylistic
reasons
In
summary
always
use
the
curly
version
for
actual
quote
and
apostrophe
marks
unless
you
are
a
using
a
typewriter
from
or
b
you
have
stylistic
reasons
for
using
the

ones

It

When

Out
of
curiosity
is
there
ever
a
need
for
apostrophes
in
code
or
command
lines
I
don
t
know
a
lot
of
coding
languages
but
I
can
t
think
of
any
instance
where
there
s
a
need

C-like

Some
languages

Javascript
allows
single

double
quotes
to
be

interchangably

you
have
to
pick
either
one

Other

As
you
can
see
many
languages
do
make
a
distinction
between
single-character
literals
and
strings
consisting
of
just
a
single
character
Both
have
valid
uses
and
both
are
regularly
used
in
many
situations
Now
whether
this
means
that
there
s
a
need
for
an
apostrophe
can
obviously
be
discussed
but
some
way
to
indicate
the
difference
to
the
compiler
or
interpreter
is
needed
in
any
language
that
does
make
the
distinction
and
many
languages
have
settled
on
the
pair
and
one
way
or
the
other

I
work
in
a
research
centre
and
we
commonly
use
fairly
large
French
and
German
corpora
fairly
recent
ones
In
the
French
corpus
the
straight
apostrophe
appears
at
about
times
the
amount
of
the
curly
apostrophe
In
the
German
one
the
straight
one
is
non
existant
and
only
the
curly
can
be
found
The
variation
in
the
French
corpus
could
actually
be
due
to
the
straight
being
commonly
used
in
typed
texts
and
the
curly
being
mostly
from
copy
paste
texts
that
are
put
online
On
the
other
hand
German
sources
appear
to
solely
use
the
curly
Some
consideration
should
also
be
put
into
the
fact
that
an
apostrophe
is
much
more
common
in
French
than
in
German

The
question
was
about
which
is
the
right
one
to
use
Now
your
input
about
real
existing
texts
is
interesting
I
love
France
and
the
fact
that
they
somehow
use
more
of
the
straight
than
the
curly
does
indirectly
confirms
that
the
curly
ones
would
be
the
proper
ones
to

The
right
character
to
put
in
published
text
as
an
apostrophe
is
the
UTF-
character
U
the
right
single
quotation
That
is
the
only
character
that
will
give
you
the
result
you
want
which
is
a
book-level
typography
apostrophe
When
you
are
using
a
writing
tool
that
does
smart
quotes
and
you
press
the
apostrophe
key
the
tool
will
insert
UTF-
character
The
UTF-
character
U
BC
modifier
letter
apostrophe
is
a
tiny
apostrophe
for
pronunciations
It
look
right
in
the
context
of
writing
The
UTF-
character
U
apostrophe
is
a
apostrophe
It
is
left
over
from
the
dawn
of
computing
when
computers
only
had
characters
and
were
designed
for
writing
computer
programs
not
producing
book-level
typography
The
first
characters
of
UTF-
are
those
same
original
characters
and
the
computer
keyboard
is
essentially
unchanged
so
this
bad
typography
lives
on
and
on
and
on
The
reason
this
bug
lives
on
is
that
people
who
come
from
a
computer
heritage
necessarily
see
programmer
apostrophes
as
bugs
People
who
come
from
a
publishing
heritage
do
But
it
is
the
computer
people
who
design
the
computers
That
is
no
excuse
for
not
using
correct
typography
in
published
text
We
have
text
substitutions
today
we
have
many
ways
around
it
Ideally
writers
should
be
using
tools
that
let
them
type
apostrophes
because
they
are
just
putting
a
bug
into
their
UTF-
manuscript
Sure
editors
will
fix
it
but
the
fix-it-later
attitude
leads
many
times
to
publishing
bugs
So
if
you
have
a
manuscript
of
any
kind
book
short
story
article
and
it
has
apostrophes
in
it
you
should
replace
them
with
UTF-
character
before
publishing
Same
goes
for
quotes
Good
writing
tools
should
not
let
the
writer
type
them
they
should
be
typing
proper
quotation
marks
especially
because
these
are
harder
to
fix
in
editing
and
lead
to
even
worse
readability
if
they
are
not
fixed
as
compared
to
apostrophes
As
a
writing
tool
example
you
can
look
at
BBEdit
which
is
a
text
editor
that
goes
back
decades
on
the
Mac
If
you
create
a
programming
document
HTML
or
other
language
and
press
the
apostrophe
key
you
get
a
apostrophe
If
you
create
a
writing
document
plain
text
or
Markdown
and
press
the
apostrophe
key
you
get
UTF-
character
Same
goes
for
quotes
In
programming
documents
you
get
the
quotes
In
writing
documents
you
get
real
quotation
marks
both
the
opening
and
closing
quotations
as
you
type
This
is
the
best
way
to
put
in
quotation
marks
because
the
tool
can
do
the
proper
open-quote
and
closed-quote
as
the
writer
is
writing
No
ambiguity
is
put
in
there
in
the
first
place
so
it
has
to
be
fixed
later
or
not

There
is
an
exception
to
your
rule
When
writing
code
or
command
line
samples
in
written
documents
the
programmers
s
apostrophe
is
the
correct
value
the
others
will
cause
syntax
errors
Blanket
bans
or
replacements
will
break
the
commands
samples
Therefore
the
character
has
to
be
allowed
for
technical
publishing
that
displays
code
or
command
line
samples

UTF-
