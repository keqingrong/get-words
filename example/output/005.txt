Word
delimiter
filter
ignore
words
with
hyphen
Elasticsearch

Hi
all
I
would
really
appreciate
if
anyone
could
navigate
me
how
I
should
set
my
word
delimiter
filter
to
skip
words
containing
hyphen
The
desired
result
is
that
the
word
with
in
them
will
be
ignored
by
word
delimiter
filter
One
possible
way
that
I
tried
to
implement
was
using
protected
words
option
with
regular
expression
but
I
am
not
sure
whether
this
is
possible
My
settings
for
word
delimiter
filter
are
as
follows
word
delimiter
filter
type
word
delimiter
preserve
original
true
generate
number
parts
false
split
on
case
change
false
split
on
numerics
false
I
tried
adding
this
protected
words
but
it
did
not
work
Is
there
any
way
to
achieve
this
Thanks
in
advance

If
I
understand
correctly
you
just
want
to
preserve
the
dashes
as
is
and
not
word-delimit
on
them
You
can
try
something
like
this
I
am
just
preserving
the
symbol
u
D
analysis
analyzer
wd
tokenizer
whitespace
filter
