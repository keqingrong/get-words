In
British
typography
the
space
dot
is
an
interpunct
used
as
the
formal
decimal
point
Its
use
is
advocated
by
laws
and
by
academic
circles
such
as
the
Cambridge
University
History
Faculty
Style
Guide
and
is
mandated
by
some
UK-based
academic
journals
such
as
The
Lancet
When
the
British
currency
was
decimalised
in
the
official
advice
issued
was
to
write
decimal
amounts
with
a
raised
point
for
example
and
to
use
a
decimal
point
on
the
line
only
when
typesetting
constraints
made
it
unavoidable
This
usage
however
has
been
declining
since
the
mid-
s
as
the
importation
of
electronic
typewriters
calculators
and
computers
from
the
United
States
and
Japan
familiarised
Britons
with
using
full
stops
and
made
the
space
dot
harder
to
typeset
citation
needed
The
space
dot
may
still
be
used
frequently
in
handwriting
however
In
the
Shavian
alphabet
interpuncts
replace
capitalization
as
the
marker
of
proper
nouns
The
dot
is
placed
at
the
beginning
of
a

Metro

The
flying
point
Catalan
punt

is
used
in
Catalan
between
two
Ls
in
cases
where
each
belongs
to
a
separate
syllable
for
example
cel
la
cell
This
distinguishes
such
geminate
Ls
ela
geminada
which
are
pronounced
from
double
L
doble

which
are
written
without
the
flying
point
and
are
pronounced
In
situations
where
the
flying
point
is
unavailable
periods
as
in
col
lecci
or
hyphens
as
in
col-lecci
are
frequently
used
as
substitutes
but
this
is
tolerated
rather
than
encouraged
Historically
medieval
Catalan
also
used
the
symbol
as
a
marker
for
certain
elisions
much
like
the
modern
apostrophe
see
Occitan
below
and
hyphenations
There
is
no
separate
keyboard
layout
for
Catalan
the
flying
point
can
be
typed
using
Shift-

It
appears
in
Unicode
as
the
letters
U
F
and
U
but
they
are
compatibility
characters
and
are
not
frequently
used
nor
recommended
Similarly
the
larger
bullet
U
bull
may
be
seen
but
is
discouraged
on
aesthetic
grounds

The
partition

point
U
Hyphenation

is
used
in
Chinese
which
generally
lacks
spacing
between
characters
to
mark
divisions
in
transliterated
foreign
words
particularly
names
This
is
properly
and
in
Taiwan
formally
a
full-width
punctuation
mark
although
sometimes
narrower
forms
are
substituted
for
aesthetic
reasons
In
particular
the
regular
interpunct
is
more
commonly
used
as
a
computer
input
although
Chinese-language
fonts
typically
render
this
as
full
width
When
the
Chinese
text
is
romanized
the
partition
sign
is
simply
replaced
by
a
standard
space
or
other
appropriate
punctuation
Thus
William

is
signified
as
or
p
W

n
Sh
sh

George
W

as

Greek
Ancient
Greek
did
not
have
spacing
or
interpuncts
but
instead
ran
all
the
letters
together

were
used
to
separate

the

also
known
as
the

is
the
infrequently-encountered
Greek
semicolon
and
is
properly
romanized

It
is
also
used
to
introduce

in
the
manner
of
an
English

it
is
also
expressed
as
an
interpunct
In
practice
the
separate
code

for
ano

canonically
decomposes
to
the
interpunct
The
Hellenistic
scholars
of
Alexandria
first
developed
the
mark
for
a
function
closer
to
the
comma
before
it
fell
out
of
use
and
was
then
repurposed
for
its
present
role
Japanese
Main

Japanese
punctuation
Interpuncts
are
often
used
to
separate
transcribed
foreign
words
written
in
katakana
For
example
Can
t
Buy
Me
Love
becomes
Kyanto
bai
m
ravu
A
middle
dot
is
also
sometimes
used
to
separate
lists
in
Japanese
instead
of
the
Japanese
comma
known
as
t
ten
Dictionaries
and
grammar
lessons
in
Japanese
sometimes
also
use
a
similar
symbol
to
separate
a
verb
suffix
from
its
root
Note
that
while
some
fonts
may
render
the
Japanese
middle
dot
as
a
square
under
great
magnification
this
is
not
a
defining
property
of
the
middle
dot
that
is
used
in
China
or
Japan
However
the
Japanese
writing
system
usually
does
not
use
space
or
punctuation
to
separate
words
though
the
mixing
of
katakana
kanji
and
hiragana
gives
some
indication
of
word
boundary
In
Japanese
typography
there
exist
two
Unicode

a
fixed

is
the
same
as
most
kana

as

The
interpunct
also
has
a
number
of
other
uses
in
Japanese
including
the
following
to
separate
titles
names
and
positions
Assistant
Section
Head

a
decimal
point
when
writing
numbers
in

in

Korean
Interpuncts
are
used
in
written
Korean
to
denote
a
list
of
two
or
more
words
more
or
less
in
the
same
way
a
slash
is
used
to
juxtapose
words
in
many
other
languages
In
this
role
it
also
functions
in
a
similar
way
to
the
English
en
dash
as
in
American
Soviet
relations
The
use
of
interpuncts
has
declined
in
years
of
digital
typography
and
especially
in
place
of
slashes
but
in
the
strictest
sense
a
slash
cannot
replace
a
middle
dot
in
Korean
typography
U

Hangul
letter
araea
is
used
more
than
a
middle
dot
when
an
interpunct
is
to
be
used
in
Korean
typography
though
araea
is
technically
not
a
punctuation
symbol
but
actually
an
obsolete
Hangul
jamo
Because
araea
is
a
full-width
letter
it
looks
better
than
middle
dot
between
Hangul
In
addition
it
is
drawn

the
middle

The
interpunct

was
regularly
used
in
classical
Latin
to

to
the
most
common
round
form
inscriptions
sometimes
use
a
small
equilateral
triangle
for
the
interpunct
pointing
either
up

down
It
may
also
appear
as
a
mid-line
comma

to
the
Greek
practice
of

especially
in
the
Gascon
dialect
the
interpunct
punt

literally
inner

is
used
to
distinguish
the
following
graphemes

be
a
spelling
error

frequently
used
when
a
middle

is
unavailable

In

the

not
in

separate
a

It
is
also
used
in

the

In

In

units
the
middle
dot

used
as
a

Only
a

be
used
as
a

In
mathematics
a
small
middle
dot
can
be
used
to
represent
product
for
example
x
y
for
the
product
of
x
and
y
When
dealing
with
scalars
it
is
interchangeable
with
the
multiplication
sign
x
y
means
the
same
thing
as
x
y
but
is
easily
confused
with
the
letter
x
However
when
dealing
with
vectors
the
dot
product
is
distinct
from
the
cross
product

usage
has
its
own
designated

It
is
also
sometimes
used
to
denote
the

relationship
in
formal
logic
due
to
the
relationship
between
these
two
operations
In

In
computing
the
middle
dot
is
usually
used
to
indicate
white
space
in
various
software
applications
such
as
word
processing
graphic
design
web
layout
desktop
publishing
or
software
development
programs
In
some
word
processors
interpuncts
are
used
to
denote
not
only
hard
space
or
space
characters
but
also
sometimes
used
to
indicate
a
space
when
put
in
paragraph
format
to
show
indentations
and
spaces
This
allows
the
user
to
see
where
white
space
is
located
in
the
document
and
what
sizes
of
white
space
are
used
since
normally
white
space
is
invisible
so
tabs
spaces
non-breaking
spaces
and
such
are
indistinguishable
from
one
another
