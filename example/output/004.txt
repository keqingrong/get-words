From
Mark
Davis
Date
Background
For
entry
field
validation
implementations
sometimes
need
to
know
which
characters
can
occur
in
personal
names
While
it
is
a
bit
fuzzy
exactly
what
this
means
they
want
to
distinguish
between
characters
like
those
in
James
Smith-Faley
Jr
and
those
in
Note
that
it
is
important
to
be
reasonably
lenient
it
is
extremely
annoying
for
people
not
to
be
able
to
add
legitimate
names
like
di
Silva
because
those
names
have
characters
like
space
Typically
these
personal
name
validations
should
not
be
language-specific
I
might
be
using
a
website
in
a
language
other
than
the
one
for
my
name
for
example
While
a
more
sophisticated
validation
might
use
context
among
characters
a
basic
validation
just
wants
to
know
what
characters
can
be
part
of
names
Much
of
this
can
be
derived
with
a
bit
of
work
from
http
www
unicode
org
reports
tr
Default
Word
Boundaries
The
basic
characterization
of
characters
that
can
be
in
words
is
from
the
combination
of
properties
Alphabetic

for
items

that
also
should
be
included
at

list
at
the
end
of
this
document
That
brings
us
to

Cf

also

other
characters
in

Proposal
Based
on
this
there
are
a
few
items
I
recommend
First
is
to
reconconcile
some
gratuitious
differences
between
word
characters
and
identifier
characters
that
were
uncovered
in
this
process
That
is
do
the
following
after
review
to
catch
exceptions
Add
the
missing
characters
from
Table
Candidate
Characters
for
Inclusion
in
Identifiers
in
TR
also
listed
in
Missing
Characters
from
Word
Break
above
to
p
Word
Break
MidLetter
Add
the
missing
characters
from
p
Word
Break
MidLetter
those
that
are
isNFKC
to
Table
Add
the
hyphen
characters
above
excluding
the
hyphen
bullet
to
p
Word
Break
MidLetter
and
those
that
are
isNFKC
to
Table
Add
an
invariant
test
for
consistency
between
the
WB
properties
and
Table
Second
is
to
have
a
list
of
name
validation
characters
that
people
can
use
That
is
make
it
easier
for
people
to
get
a
set
of
name-validation
characters
by
at
providing
a
list
of
the
exceptional
characters
in
a
new
section
of
TR
Aside
from
the
above
characters
this
list
would
also
include
and
their
variants
and
space
and
its
variants
The
text
in
that
section
needs
have
a
number
of
caveats
to
make
it
clear
what
the
limitations
on
the
use
of
the
list
are
In
particular
It
is
only
a
guideline
and
may
need
tailoring
for
different
environments
It
is
a
lenient
non-language-specific
set
for
language-specific
characters
one
should
see
CLDR
It
includes
characters
that
may
not
be
appropriate
for
identifiers
and
those
that
would
not
be
parts
of
words
It
does
not
include
contextual
tests
Additional
tests
may
be
needed
in
cases
where
security
is
at
issue
The
set
can
be
narrowed
if
name
fields
are
split
out
For
example
may
not
be
necessary
if
titles
are
split
out
if
titles
are
not
allowed
may
not
be
necessary
It
contains
some
other
characters
that
may
be
part
of
words
in
a
broad
sense
such
as
c
a
in
Swedish
or
a
dictionary
word
containing
hyphenation
points
that
might
not
normally
be
part
of
names
