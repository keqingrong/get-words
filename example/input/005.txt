 :tada: We're Doubling Down on Open :tada:

As we just announced at our Elastic{ON} 2018 Keynote, we're going to be opening the code for X-Pack as of our 6.3 release!

For all the details head over to the announcement blog post, from Shay Banon -
https://www.elastic.co/blog/doubling-down-on-open

I am excited to announce that we will be opening the code of our X-Pack features - security, monitoring, alerting, graph, reporting, dedicated APM UIs, Canvas, Elasticsearch SQL, Search Profiler, Grok Debugger, Elastic Maps Service zoom levels, and machine learning - to facilitate greater collaboration with our customers and community in much the same way we do for our open source code today.

Word delimiter filter - ignore words with hyphen
Elasticsearch

Patrick_NorwoodJan '14
Hi all,

I would really appreciate if anyone could navigate me, how I should set my
word_delimiter_filter to skip words containing hyphen? The desired result
is that the word with '-' in them, will be ignored by word delimiter filter.
One possible way that I tried to implement was using protected_words option
with regular expression - but I am not sure whether this is possible.
My settings for word_delimiter_filter are as follows:
:word_delimiter_filter => {
"type" => 'word_delimiter',
"preserve_original" => true,
"generate_number_parts" => false,
"split_on_case_change" => false,
"split_on_numerics" => false,
}

I tried adding this: "protected_words" => [/.-./] ...but it did not
work.

Is there any way to achieve this? Thanks in advance.

Patrick,

If I understand correctly, you just want to preserve the dashes as is and
not "word-delimit" on them. You can try something like this (I am just
preserving the - symbol: \u002D):

  "analysis": {
    "analyzer": {
      "wd1": {
        "tokenizer": "whitespace",
        "filter": [
          "wd1"
        ]
      }
    },
    "filter": {
      "wd1": {
        "type": "word_delimiter",
        "type_table": [
          "\\u002D => ALPHANUM"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
